# Portfolio

## Description
* I developed a webpage that is now my portfolio. It entails a little about myself, some filler photos until I can build my personal portfolio up. Also I have added a contact me section so you can easily email me if someone wanted to reach out. Below that is a link to a printable version of my resume.
