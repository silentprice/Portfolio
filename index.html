        <p>
            My name is Nick Price, I have been interested in creating and innovating since I was real young. Dropping out of college at the age of 19 still loving architecture and wanting to develop. I taught myself
            how to day trade and read markets. I went back to engineering school at 21 only to change my major to business one semester later. The following year I left school to take a marketing job in NYC.
            I realized my second day on the job after 3 days of interviewing that commuting to NYC at 4:40 every morning was just not for me. Two months later I was back at UPS as your local delivery guy, afer two winters on helping inside the building.  
            I definately did not want to do that for the next 40 years so I began my plan. 
             I was an athlete growing up and into college. I never really considered being on a computer to be those things, until I started buying domains and could not get past the html, had know idea what css meant nor thought I could ever understand these kind of languages. Now I am hooked on 
            learning how to become a great programmer so I can achieve what I have been trying to build for the past few years. I really enjoy problem solving and
            engineering innovating technology. Some of the ideas I was building into my websites have now been achieved by other companies, as I was young and did not 
            know how to proceed, Now, I feel the last piece to the puzzle is this course and my dedication to learning as many new languages as possible and understanding them.
