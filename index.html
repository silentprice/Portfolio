        <p>
            My name is Nick Price, I have been interesting in creating and innovating since I was real young. I was an athlete growing up and into college.
            I never really considered being on a computer to be those things, until I started buying domains and could not get past the html. Now I am hooked on 
            learning how to become a great programmer so I can achieve what I have been trying to build for the past few years. I really enjoy problem solving and
            engineering innovating technology. Some of the ideas I was building into my websites have be now achieved by other companys, as I was young and did not 
            know how to proceed, Now, I feel the last piece to the puzzle is this course and my dedication to learning as many new languages as possible and understanding them.
